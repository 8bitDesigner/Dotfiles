Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff 
at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. The hard 
thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on 
it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.
